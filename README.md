## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system uses a two-stage LangGraph workflow:

### 1. Architect Agent - Research & Planning
![Architect Agent](./static/architect.png)

The architect agent:
- Researches the codebase structure and patterns
- Analyzes requirements and creates hypotheses
- Generates detailed implementation plans with atomic tasks
- Uses tools for code search and semantic understanding

### 2. Developer Agent - Implementation
![Developer Agent](./static/developer.png)

The developer agent:
- Executes implementation plans step by step
- Performs atomic code modifications with precision
- Creates new files and modifies existing ones
- Validates changes against the original requirements

### Workflow Overview
```
User Request ‚Üí Architect (Research & Plan) ‚Üí Developer (Implement) ‚Üí Results
```

**Key Components:**
- **State Management**: Structured data flow between agents using Pydantic models
- **Tool Integration**: File system operations, code search, and structure analysis
- **Research Pipeline**: Hypothesis-driven exploration of codebases
- **Atomic Execution**: Granular tasks for reliable implementation

## üîÑ Agent State Management

The system uses a hierarchical state management approach with Pydantic models for type safety and validation. Each agent maintains its own state while sharing common entities for seamless data flow.

### Main Agent State (`AgentState`)

The top-level orchestrator state that manages the overall workflow:

```python
class AgentState(BaseModel):
    implementation_research_scratchpad: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]
    implementation_plan: Optional[ImplementationPlan] = None
```

**Fields:**
- `implementation_research_scratchpad`: Message history from research and planning phase
- `implementation_plan`: Structured plan created by architect agent for developer execution

### Architect Agent State (`SoftwareArchitectState`)

Manages the research and planning phase with hypothesis-driven exploration:

```python
class SoftwareArchitectState(BaseModel):
    research_next_step: Optional[str] = None
    implementation_plan: Optional[ImplementationPlan] = None  
    implementation_research_scratchpad: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages] = []
    is_valid_research_step: Optional[bool] = None
```

**Fields:**
- `research_next_step`: Current hypothesis or research direction being explored
- `implementation_plan`: Generated structured plan with atomic tasks
- `implementation_research_scratchpad`: Research conversation history and tool outputs
- `is_valid_research_step`: Validation flag for research hypothesis quality

**Workflow:**
1. Generate research hypothesis ‚Üí Validate hypothesis ‚Üí Conduct research ‚Üí Extract implementation plan

### Developer Agent State (`SoftwareDeveloperState`)

Handles the step-by-step implementation of the architect's plan:

```python
class SoftwareDeveloperState(BaseModel):
    implementation_plan: Optional[ImplementationPlan] = None
    current_task_idx: Optional[int] = 0
    current_atomic_task_idx: Optional[int] = 0
    diffs: Optional[Diffs] = None
    atomic_implementation_research: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages_with_clear]
    codebase_structure: Optional[str] = None
    current_file_content: Optional[str] = None
```

**Fields:**
- `implementation_plan`: Plan received from architect agent
- `current_task_idx`: Index of current file-level task being implemented
- `current_atomic_task_idx`: Index of current atomic change within the task
- `diffs`: Generated code differences for precise file modifications
- `atomic_implementation_research`: Research specific to current implementation step
- `codebase_structure`: Current snapshot of target codebase structure
- `current_file_content`: Contents of file being modified

**Workflow:**
1. Iterate through tasks ‚Üí Research specific implementation ‚Üí Generate diffs ‚Üí Apply changes

### Shared Entities

These Pydantic models provide the data contracts between agents:

#### `ImplementationPlan`
```python
class ImplementationPlan(BaseModel):
    tasks: List[ImplementationTask]
```
The top-level plan containing all file-level implementation tasks.

#### `ImplementationTask`  
```python
class ImplementationTask(BaseModel):
    file_path: str                    # Target file for modifications
    logical_task: str                 # High-level description of changes
    atomic_tasks: List[AtomicTask]    # Granular modification steps
```
Represents changes needed for a specific file.

#### `AtomicTask`
```python
class AtomicTask(BaseModel):
    atomic_task: str            # Specific code modification instruction
    additional_context: str     # Research context for this change
```
The smallest unit of implementation - a single code change.

#### `DiffTask` (Developer-specific)
```python
class DiffTask(BaseModel):
    original_code_snippet: str    # Exact code being replaced
    task_description: str         # Detailed change instructions
```
Precise diff instructions for code modifications.

### State Flow Example

```
User Request
    ‚Üì
AgentState {research_scratchpad: [HumanMessage("Add auth")]}
    ‚Üì
SoftwareArchitectState {
    research_next_step: "Find existing auth patterns",
    implementation_research_scratchpad: [research_messages...]
}
    ‚Üì (after research)
SoftwareArchitectState {
    implementation_plan: ImplementationPlan([
        ImplementationTask(
            file_path: "auth.py",
            atomic_tasks: [AtomicTask("Add User model")]
        )
    ])
}
    ‚Üì
SoftwareDeveloperState {
    implementation_plan: <received_plan>,
    current_task_idx: 0,
    current_atomic_task_idx: 0,
    current_file_content: "# auth.py content"
}
    ‚Üì (after implementation)
Final Result: Modified codebase
```

### State Management Benefits

- **Type Safety**: Pydantic validation prevents state corruption
- **Traceability**: Complete message history for debugging
- **Resumability**: State can be persisted and resumed
- **Modularity**: Each agent manages its own concerns
- **Atomicity**: Granular task breakdown enables precise control

## üí° Real Usage Example

Here's a complete example of using SWE Agent LangGraph on a real project:

### Scenario: Enhancing the Browser-Use Agent

Let's improve the [browser-use](https://github.com/gregpr07/browser-use) agent to save screenshots for investigation.

**Task**: "You are given a codebase for an agent that can take browser screenshots and act intelligently. You need to save the screenshots along the way to ensure I can investigate them after the agent has finished"

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Clone the target repository**
```bash
# Clone the repository you want to work on into workspace_repo
git clone https://github.com/gregpr07/browser-use.git workspace_repo
cd workspace_repo

# Verify the codebase structure
ls -la
# Should show: browser_use/, tests/, examples/, etc.
```

2. **Create a feature branch for the agent's changes**
```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch for the enhancement
git checkout -b feature/swe-agent-screenshot-saving

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch
# Should show: * feature/swe-agent-screenshot-saving
```

3. **Return to SWE agent directory and run**
```bash
cd ..  # Back to swe-agent-langgraph directory

# Start the LangGraph server
langgraph dev
```

4. **Execute the agent workflow**
```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
from agent.graph import swe_agent

# Define the enhancement task
task_description = """
You are given a codebase for an agent that can take browser screenshots and act intelligently. 
You need to save the screenshots along the way to ensure I can investigate them after the agent has finished.

The browser-use agent should:
1. Save each screenshot with a timestamp and action description
2. Create a screenshots directory if it doesn't exist  
3. Maintain a log of screenshot filenames and their corresponding actions
4. Ensure screenshots are saved before and after critical actions
"""

# Run the complete workflow
async def enhance_browser_use():
    result = await swe_agent.ainvoke({
        "implementation_research_scratchpad": [
            HumanMessage(content=task_description)
        ]
    })
    return result

# Execute the enhancement
result = await enhance_browser_use()
```

### What the Agent Will Do

#### Phase 1: Architect Agent Research
The architect will:
- üîç **Analyze the browser-use codebase** structure and patterns
- üìã **Research existing screenshot functionality** in browser_use/
- üéØ **Identify integration points** for screenshot saving
- üìù **Create implementation plan** with atomic tasks

#### Phase 2: Developer Agent Implementation  
The developer will:
- üìÅ **Create screenshot storage system** with timestamped filenames
- üîß **Modify browser action methods** to save screenshots automatically
- üìä **Add screenshot logging** for action tracking
- ‚úÖ **Test the implementation** to ensure it works correctly

### Reviewing and Managing the Changes

```bash
cd workspace_repo

# Check what files were modified/created
git status
# Will show modified and new files

# Review all changes made by the agent
git diff
# Shows line-by-line changes in existing files

# See new files that were created
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard
# Shows untracked files (new files created by agent)

# Add all changes to staging
git add .

# Commit the agent's work
git commit -m "feat: add screenshot saving functionality via SWE agent

- Add screenshot manager for timestamped saving
- Integrate screenshot capture in browser actions  
- Create screenshot logging system
- Add examples showing screenshot functionality"
```

### Expected Changes

After the agent completes its work, you'll see changes like:

```bash
# Modified files (git diff will show these changes)
M  browser_use/browser/browser.py          # Enhanced with screenshot calls
M  browser_use/controller/controller.py    # Added screenshot logging
M  examples/quickstart_browser.py          # Updated to show screenshot usage

# New files (git ls-files --others will show these)
?? browser_use/screenshot_manager.py       # New screenshot handling module
?? screenshots/.gitkeep                    # Directory structure
?? examples/enhanced_browser_example.py    # New example with screenshots
```

### Merging the Changes

```bash
# Switch back to main branch to compare
git checkout main

# See the difference between branches
git diff feature/swe-agent-screenshot-saving

# Merge the agent's changes (after review)
git merge feature/swe-agent-screenshot-saving

# Or create a pull request if working with a team
git push origin feature/swe-agent-screenshot-saving
# Then create PR on GitHub: main ‚Üê feature/swe-agent-screenshot-saving
```

### Testing the Implementation

```bash
# On the feature branch, test the new functionality
git checkout feature/swe-agent-screenshot-saving

# Run the enhanced example
python examples/enhanced_browser_example.py

# Check if screenshots are being saved
ls -la screenshots/
# Should show timestamped screenshot files

# Verify the screenshot log
cat screenshots/screenshot_log.json
# Should show JSON log of all screenshots taken
```

### Advanced Usage Tips

**Custom Instructions**: You can provide more specific requirements:
```python
detailed_task = """
Enhance the browser-use agent with advanced screenshot management:

1. Save screenshots in organized subdirectories by session
2. Implement screenshot comparison to detect significant changes
3. Add screenshot annotation with action descriptions overlaid
4. Create a web viewer for browsing saved screenshots
5. Integrate with existing logging system for better traceability
"""
```

**Iterative Improvements**: Run multiple cycles for refinements:
```python
# First enhancement
result1 = await swe_agent.ainvoke({"implementation_research_scratchpad": [HumanMessage(content=basic_task)]})

# Review changes on the branch
# git diff, test, etc.

# Second iteration for improvements
refinement_task = "Improve the screenshot saving to include browser viewport info and user session tracking"
result2 = await swe_agent.ainvoke({"implementation_research_scratchpad": [HumanMessage(content=refinement_task)]})

# Each iteration adds to the same branch, creating cumulative improvements
```

This example demonstrates the power of SWE Agent LangGraph to understand complex codebases and implement sophisticated enhancements automatically, with full Git workflow integration for professional development practices!
